### Welcome to Reuben's GitHub profile!

I'm a product-driven creative technologist [based in New York City](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy_XTm-RzNt/) with a multi-disciplinary background in research science, humanities, and the arts. At _New York Magazine_ and _Vox Media_, I worked to deliver award-winning reader experiences and critical back-end services in support of editorial tooling and business development goals during a period of rapid growth (400% YoY) in the e-commmerce and affiliate revenue business.

In recent personal work, I've explored the usage of mobile devices as sonic architecture in [Frog Chor.us](https://frogchor.us) and the intersection of archives, machine learning, and music on the early web in [MIDI ARCHIVE](https://reubenson.com/midi-archive).

I bring a deep, human-centric toolkit to questions of both how and what to build with technology, and am currently looking out for new professional opportunities, so please get in touch if you think I would be a welcome collaborator with you or someone you know!
